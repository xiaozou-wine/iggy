    //!
    //! The window is not peer shards on one node: a committed reply is only
    //! produced after `gated_apply` published, and every shard reads the same
    //! left-right buffers. It is a node whose commit walk trails the epoch the
    //! client already holds. Register forwarding is the supported way to get
    //! there -- a backup verifies the credentials itself, forwards only the
    //! consensus proposal, and binds the committed session while its own
    //! `commit_journal` is still behind that op (see
    //! `server::dispatch::session_ops`).
    //!
    //! Blocking replication INTO one backup while the quorum commits without
    //! it produces the lag deterministically, and the login still completes
    //! because `ForwardRegister` / `ForwardRegisterResult` are left flowing.
    //!
    //! One shard per replica for the end-to-end read, deliberately. The harness
    //! homes each inbound client packet on a seeded-random shard while every
    //! shard owns its own `SessionManager`, so on a multi-shard replica a bound
    //! session cannot reliably receive its own follow-up requests -- and the lag
    //! under test is the node's, not a shard's.
    //!
    //! The second test is the other half: peer shards are not the WINDOW, but
    //! they are how a peer-homed read learns the node's position at all, and
    //! sharing one frontier cell across a replica's shards is what makes that
    //! work. It runs multi-shard and drives the cell directly, so it needs no
    //! session and dodges the homing problem entirely.
