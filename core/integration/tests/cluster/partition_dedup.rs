//! Spec tests for partition-plane request dedup (IGGY-274).
//!
//! Each partition consensus group keeps a slice of the VSR client table:
//! per-client request watermarks folded in at commit. A replay of an
//! already-committed `(client, request)` is answered with the empty success its
//! original earned instead of committing a second copy.
//!
//! The frames are hand-crafted on a raw TCP socket for the same reason
//! `client_table_restart` does it: the Rust SDK mints a fresh `client_id` and
//! request id per attempt, so it cannot express "the same request, twice" --
//! which is precisely the input under test. The SDK is still used for setup and
//! for reading the log back, where it is the more honest observer.
