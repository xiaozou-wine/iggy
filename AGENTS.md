# Apache Iggy Agent Guidelines

**Apache Iggy** is a persistent message streaming platform
in Rust. Thread-per-core shared-nothing, `io_uring` + `compio`.
Transports: QUIC, WebSocket, TCP (custom binary), HTTP (REST). SDKs:
Rust, .NET, Java, Python, Go, C++, Node.js. A connectors subsystem
ingests from / egresses to external systems via dlopened plugins.

> Skills live under `.claude/skills/`, with per-skill links under

> [connectors-overview](.claude/skills/connectors-overview/SKILL.md)
> first for any change under `core/connectors/`. Other subsystems
> follow the repo-wide principles in this file.

## STOP and ask the user before

- Bumping `iggy_connector_sdk` MAJOR version or changing any FFI
  signature in `core/connectors/sdk/src/{sink,source}.rs` (breaks
  every pre-built plugin .so).
- Modifying `core/binary_protocol/` wire-format types tagged
  `#[repr(C)]` (breaks every running client).
- Touching the state-save path (`core/connectors/runtime/src/state.rs`)
  in a way that changes the atomic-rename protocol (corruption risk).
- Renaming default consumer groups, plugin path resolution rules, or
  any other operator-facing identifier.
- Force-pushing to `master`, amending shipped commits, or skipping
  hooks with `--no-verify` / `--no-gpg-sign`.

## Helping someone contribute

Most PRs from people new to Iggy are written with an agent. The person opening the PR is responsible for it, and maintainers close PRs that read as a relay between reviewer and model. Read the AI Assistance, Bugs Found by an Agent and Close Policy sections of CONTRIBUTING.md before helping open a PR.

- The PR must link an issue the user is assigned to. If it doesn't, stop and tell them.
- Run `prek run` before the PR is opened. If prek isn't installed, ask the user to install it (`cargo install prek`, then `prek install`). Don't substitute the individual checks.
- If a check can't run, tell the user which one and why, and treat the PR as not ready. Never write text in a PR asking a maintainer to run something.
- The user should write the rationale in their own words and be able to explain every change without asking you.
- New contributors keep one open PR at a time.
- If you found a bug, the first PR holds a failing test. The fix waits until the approach is agreed on the issue.

## Quick reference

```bash
# Verification order is enforced by CI (.github/actions/rust/pre-merge).
cargo fmt --all                                            # step 1
cargo sort --no-format --workspace                         # step 2 (--no-format mandatory)
cargo clippy --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings   # step 3
cargo test -p <crate>                                      # step 4

# Other CI checks (mirror in pre-commit; pass --fix where supported)
./scripts/ci/taplo.sh             # TOML
./scripts/ci/markdownlint.sh      # Markdown
./scripts/ci/shellcheck.sh        # Shell
./scripts/ci/license-headers.sh   # Apache headers
./scripts/ci/trailing-whitespace.sh
./scripts/ci/trailing-newline.sh
./scripts/ci/sync-rustc-version.sh
./scripts/ci/python-sdk-version-sync.sh
./scripts/ci/uv-lock-check.sh
./scripts/ci/binary-artifacts.sh --check
./scripts/ci/third-party-licenses.sh --validate --manifest <path>

# Run things
cargo run --bin iggy-server
cargo run --bin iggy -- <subcommand>
IGGY_CONNECTORS_CONFIG_PATH=... cargo run --bin iggy-connectors
./scripts/run-bdd-tests.sh
./scripts/run-benches.sh
```

Pre-commit hooks wire the same scripts. Install with `pre-commit
install` (Python) or `prek install` (Rust drop-in) - both read
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

| Task                  | Location                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Wire protocol         | `core/binary_protocol/`                  |
| Server                | `core/server/src/`                       |
| Rust client SDK       | `core/sdk/src/`                          |
| Connectors            | `core/connectors/` -> connector-* skills |

## Skills

Each `SKILL.md` has YAML frontmatter (name, description). For
connectors work, load `connectors-overview` first as router.
Claude Code uses `/skill-name`; Codex uses `$skill-name` or `/skills`.
Keep one source under `.claude/skills/` and link its directory from
`.agents/skills/`. Keep templates and references inside the source directory.

- [connectors-overview](.claude/skills/connectors-overview/SKILL.md) - router + universal connector rules
- [connector-runtime](.claude/skills/connector-runtime/SKILL.md) - FFI host, lifecycle, state, metrics
- [connector-sdk](.claude/skills/connector-sdk/SKILL.md) - traits, decoders/encoders, retry
- [connector-sink](.claude/skills/connector-sink/SKILL.md) - sink plugin authoring
- [connector-source](.claude/skills/connector-source/SKILL.md) - source plugin authoring
- [connector-transform](.claude/skills/connector-transform/SKILL.md) - transform authoring
- [connector-testing](.claude/skills/connector-testing/SKILL.md) - unit + integration test patterns

Review skills are user-invoked only. Keep `disable-model-invocation: true`
for Claude Code and `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in
`agents/openai.yaml` for Codex. Do not replicate their steps without an
explicit invocation. When a non-trivial change passes verification,
suggest `/team-review <target>` in Claude Code or `$team-review <target>`
in Codex.

- [connector-review](.claude/skills/connector-review/SKILL.md) - adversarial connectors PR/branch review with validation
- [team-review](.claude/skills/team-review/SKILL.md) - adversarial 4-expert PR/branch review, ~10 subagents per run
- [team-review-slim](.claude/skills/team-review-slim/SKILL.md) - four-expert review without independent validation rounds

Review skills share [execution instructions](.claude/skills/team-review/references/execution.md)
for target preparation and client-specific agent tools. Run
`./scripts/ci/skills.sh` to check skill metadata, links, and invocation policies.

## Repo-wide principles

1. **Apache 2.0 header on every new source file:** Follow the comment style configured in `licenserc.toml`; common examples: `.rs` uses `// ...`, `Cargo.toml` and shell use `# ...`.
2. **Verification order:** `fmt --all` -> `sort --no-format --workspace` -> `clippy --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings` -> `test`. Plus `taplo.sh --check`. CI enforces all.
3. **Always pass `--no-format` to `cargo sort`.** Without it multi-line feature arrays flatten and `taplo` re-expands them, churning the workspace.
4. **Avoid LLM-slop tells: em dashes, gratuitous semicolons, hedging narrative, trailing summaries.** Defaults, not absolute bans. Same rule for code, comments, commits, PR descriptions.
5. **Idiomatic Rust over free helpers.** `FromStr` not `parse_foo`, `Display` not `format_foo`, `From`/`TryFrom` not `to_foo_from_bar`. Structured `Err` enums, not `String`.
6. **Imports at the top.** No inline `use` inside functions or blocks. Group: std, external crates, then `crate::`.
7. **Precise names.** No `b`, `p`, `t`, `m`. Match literal API field names as log labels.
8. **Comments explain WHY, not WHAT.** Default to no comment. Add one only when a hidden constraint or workaround would surprise a future reader. Never reference the current task / PR.
9. **Never `cargo install`** without authorization. Toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. CI installs additional cargo tools on demand. If a required tool such as prek is missing, ask the user to install it rather than skipping the check.
10. **No `unwrap()` / `expect()` on Results from external I/O** outside tests.
11. **`tokio::sync::Mutex` (not `std::sync::Mutex`)** wherever a lock is held across `.await`. Hold locks briefly: lock, clone, drop guard, then do I/O.
12. **Code reads top to bottom.** Public consts and public fns first, helpers below, deeper helpers below those.
13. **Zero clone in hot loops.** `&self`, `&str`, `&[T]`. `Vec::with_capacity(n)` when size is known.
14. **Forward-compatible config.** New TOML fields use `#[serde(default)]` or `Option<T>`.

## Tooling

| `cargo about` + `license-checker-rseidelsohn` | `scripts/ci/third-party-licenses.sh`        |
| HawkEye / `license-headers.sh`                | pre-commit + CI                             |
| `uv`, `ruff`                                  | pre-commit (Python)                         |
| `golangci-lint`                               | pre-push (Go)                               |

## Testing

- **Unit:** `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at EOF of `src/lib.rs` (or per-module).
- **In-crate integration:** `<crate>/tests/`.
- **Cross-crate (real infra):** `core/integration/tests/`. Harness in
  `core/integration/src/harness/` spawns real `iggy-server`
  (`ServerHandle`), connectors runtime (`ConnectorsRuntimeHandle`),
  MCP server (`McpHandle`), client (`ClientHandle`). `#[iggy_harness]`
  proc macro wires fixtures. Suites: `cli/`, `cluster/`,
  `config_provider/`, `connectors/`, `data_integrity/`, `mcp/`, `sdk/`,
  `server/`, `state/`, `storage/`. External backends inside
  `connectors/` use `testcontainers-modules`. Per-test logs land in
  `test_logs/`.
- **Cross-SDK BDD:** `bdd/`. Gherkin features against every SDK. Driver: `scripts/run-bdd-tests.sh`.

BDD test naming: `given_X_when_Y_should_Z` (3-part). Promote to 4-part `given_X_when_Y_then_Z_should_W` only with a distinct "then" intermediate. Be consistent inside a file.

Filter a single integration test by path. Build the binaries the harness launches first: it runs
whatever is already in `target/`, so a stale one fails as though the change under test broke it.

```bash
cargo build --bin iggy-server --bin iggy-connectors
cargo test -p integration -- connectors::runtime::benchmark::given_logging_format_json
```

## Pitfalls

- **Docker is required for most integration tests.** `testcontainers-modules` spawns containers per test.
- **`cargo sort` without `--no-format` will churn the workspace.** Use the pre-commit hook.
- **Rust toolchain is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`.** Older system `cargo` fails on transitive deps. prefer rustup so the pin auto-resolves.
- **`test_logs/` grows quickly.** Wipe between major refactors.
- **Miri only covers `binary_protocol` + `consensus`.** Cannot emulate `io_uring` syscalls. do not try to expand Miri to crates that pull `compio`.
- **Integration crate has no `--test` target.** Filter by test path inside the single `mod.rs` binary.
- **The integration harness runs prebuilt binaries and never builds them.** `Command::cargo_bin` only resolves a path, so a stale `iggy-server`, `iggy-connectors` or `iggy-mcp` is used silently. CI builds first (`cargo build --locked --bin iggy-server --bin iggy`); a local run does not, and a stale binary fails in ways that look like the change under test. Rebuild after anything that touches a launched binary or its config.

## Local state directories

Created by server, connectors runtime, or tests. Gitignored. Safe to delete to reset:

- `local_data/` - server data
- `local_state/` - connectors runtime state files
- `test_logs/` - per-test logs + `local_data` snapshots
- `performance_results/` - benchmark output
- `target/` - cargo build

## Commits, PRs, releases
